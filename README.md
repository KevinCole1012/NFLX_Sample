# NFLX Sample

This branch contains a sample of Kevin Cole's work. It includes R and Python code he has developed in addition to a Markdown sample. 

The scripts are used in the course of quantitatively evaluating equity securities and portfolios consisting of stocks. They span statistical and econometric techniques tailored to this use case (e.g. correlation.R, regressionFunctions.R), as well as more involved routines (e.g. portfolioSummary.R used to broadly evaluate portfolios; and class_model_estimation.py used to forecast future stock returns).
